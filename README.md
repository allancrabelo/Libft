# Libft
The Libft project is a foundational assignment at 42 School, where I developed a custom C library from scratch. It includes reimplementations of standard functions like 'memset', 'strlen', 'atoi', etc. This project enhanced my expertise in memory management, string manipulation and efficient algorithm design.
