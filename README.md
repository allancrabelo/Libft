# Libft
The Libft project is a foundational assignment at 42 School, where I developed a custom C library from scratch. It includes reimplementations of standard functions like 'memset', 'strlen', 'atoi', etc. This project enhanced my expertise in memory management, string manipulation and efficient algorithm design.


TODO strlcat || strncat????
TODO memcmp
TODO calloc

TODO update makefile and header.
TODO replace atoi for ft_atoi.
